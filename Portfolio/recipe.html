    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350° F | 175°C. Line a 9" cast iron skillet (or pie dish) with<br> baking/parchment paper and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk the butter, sugar and vanilla until light and creamy.<br> Whisk in the egg until combined. Add the flour, baking soda and salt, and mix <br>the dry ingredients into the wet until just combined. Fold in half of the chocolate <br>chips and spoon 1/2 the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Melt the Nutella in the microwave for 30 seconds until it becomes thinner in<br> consistency</li>
      <li>Spread the Nutella over the cookie dough in the skillet evenly to 1-inch <br>of the edges. Top with remaining cookie dough, smoothing the layer with the back <br>of a metal spoon (and your fingers if you need to). Sprinkle with remaining chocolate<br> chips.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes for a gooey cookie, or cover after <br>30 minutes with aluminium foil and bake for a further 10 minutes for a 'set' cookie.<br> Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>

      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Spray a 9×5″ bread pan with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the oil and sugar. Add in the eggs and <br>whisk again, but be sure to not over mix.</li>
        <li>Dump the dry ingredients, banana and chocolate chips on the wet <br>ingredients and switching to a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold the <br>ingredients together just until a few streaks of flour remain.</li>
        <li>Pour into a bread pan and bake for 50 minutes. At this point, barely <br>open the oven and slide a piece of tinfoil over the bread, close the door and <br>bake for the remaining 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the bread is done, open the oven door, turn off the oven and let the<br> banana bread rest for 2-3 minutes, no longer, before carefully setting it on <br>the counter for a few more minutes. At this point, slide a knife around the <br>inside of the pan and carefully turn the bread out into your other hand or onto <br>the cooling rack directly if you are gentle. Place it right side up and allow <br>to cool or be like us and dig in because warm bread is the best!</li>
