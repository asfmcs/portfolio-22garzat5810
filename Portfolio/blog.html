    <h3 id="HTML"><em>Learning HTML...</em></h3>
    <p >Throughout this unit I have learned a lot of things about HTML.<br> One of them is that HTML is a markup language that produces the <br>websites we use and view in the internet. I have also learned how <br>to make undorderd and ordered lists, add pictures to my websites<br> using links that end with jpg, and create external and internal links <br>in the website using hyperlinks. <br><br>Other things I have learned with HTML is how to add class and id to either <br>headings,paragraph, and images to use in CSS. This helped <br>us label our content specifially so we can edit our <br>website more professionally. Also how to make <br>tables using table, thead, tr, and td. And this <br>helped us produce recpies with incregdients and quantities.</p>
    <h3 id="CSS"><em>Learning CSS...</em></h3>
    <p>In CSS I have learned to style and personalize my website with colors, fonts,<br> table decorations, and backgroudn colors. The first thing we learned was how<br> to use RGB colors since it is what you use in CSS to add color to you <br>website. Then we learned hwo to use id and classes to label our content more <br>specifically. This helped us personalize oru website with more detail and <br>complexity. <br><br>Then we learned how to add fonts to our websites. We <br>would use font families to style them however we wanted. This could be <br>applied to either paragraphs, table, list, and headings. And finally after <br>learnig all of this we learned about table properties and how to style them. <br>We could make table borders and change their thickness and color. Also change their <br>alignment using CSS so we could put the table either in the middle, left,<br> or right, and this made our tables look more organised and apealing.
